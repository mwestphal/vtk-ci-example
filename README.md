All is handled in the yml files, you can copy the onw you need in your own project
on any gitlab instance or on github to be able to build and test your VTK based modules or applications.

Build and test with a VTK image
====================================
The provided yml files use VTK v9.1.0 to build and test.
To choose another version, just change the `image` tag in your yml file to point to another image.
Available images are visible on [vtk-for-ci][] dockerhub repository.

Graphical testing is supported using [xvfb-run][] and mesa.
